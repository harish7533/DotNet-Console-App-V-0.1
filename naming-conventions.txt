When and Where to use the proper naming conventions in C#.
Resource link:- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names

Pascal casing
1. Public members of types, such as fields, properties, events.
2. local functions, class names, method names, constant names, both fields and local constants.

Camel casing
1. when naming private or internal fields and prefix them with _.
2. when naming local variables, method parameters, including instances of a delegate type.

When working with static fields that are private or internal, use the s_ prefix and for thread static use t_.

Use S for structs, C for classes.
Use M for methods.
Use v for variables, p for parameters.
Use r for ref parameters.

Private instance fields start with an underscore (_) and the remaining text is camelCased.

Static fields start with s_.

Interface names start with a capital I.

Attribute types end with the word Attribute.

Enum types use a singular noun for nonflags, and a plural noun for flags.

Identifiers shouldn't contain two consecutive underscore (_) characters. Those names are reserved for compiler-generated identifiers.
